            "title": "Blogging with Org mode and FastPages",
            "content": "1 Introduction . Jeremy and Rachel, esteemed founders of fastai, quote Blogging is like Resume, only better in this post. Blogging really is one of the best medium to learn while doing. It helps to communicate and formulate ideas, and share knowledge with your peers and colleagues. Blogging for me addresses provides three main motivations: . It helps in improving communication and writing skills. | It provide medium to showcase technical expertise in programming, data science and other domains. | It is a great medium for self learning and teaching. | With nbdev, fastai library and video courses; Fastai team has contributed some of the best material and tools for learning data science specificaaly and programming in general. The top down learning style , with focus on learning the big picture by execution and programming, is an amazingly useful and productive technique especially for someone who is working full time. . Fastpages is the recent addition in the same tradition of tools made available by FastAI team to new and practicing data scientist to facilitate there learning journey. It capitalizes on nbdev codebases, a python literate programming tool and github actions to enable blogging by jupyter notebook and markdown files. . My objective in this post is to showcase some of the minor changes which I have made which enables me to use entire toolchain of fastpages; to blog with emacs org mode along with notebook, markdown or word format. I also intend to demonstrate how powerful org mode really is ; and why it belongs in a Data Scientist toolbox alongwith the list of tools mentioned above. . 2 EMACS ORG-MODE: WHAT? WHY? HOW? . BEFORE CAME JUPYTER, BEFORE CAME INTERNET AND EVEN BEFORE THERE WERE PERSONAL COMPUTERS.THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED EMACS . 2.1 The What? . So what is org-mode? At the very basic level org mode or org format is a text markup defined for structured text editing. It is similar to markdown as it is defined in plaintext, priortizes readability and has an human centric approach. Combination with emacs elisp system makes it insanely powerful. Instead of yet another markup syntax; it becomes a system of text editing which is highly extensible and infinitly programmable. With various open source plugins&#39; it can be used like a literate programming tool like notebooks or frontend for latex report creation or even online presentations. . 2.2 The Why? . So why should you be interested in Org Mode .Here is a brief list of things that you can do with it. . 2.2.1 Blogging . You can write a blog post like this. Since Emacs is insanely powerful for text editing you can do really fast typing. . 2.2.2 Literate Programming . You can do literate programming just like jupyter notebooks, create latex reports, even write full fledged books. . 2.2.3 GTD, Task Manager, Todo . You can use it as task manager, do project management, create to do list. Follow the recommendations of GTD managing your life in a text edit. And many many more things. A good set of references are in following playlist . 2.2.4 FastPages Functionality . Lot of bells and whistle related to boxes and link are enabled using org mode link functionality . Links are prepended by a directive | When doing html export link get converted into jekyll include statement already defined in the code | When exporting to other backends it follows the same structure as normal link for that structure | .

I will be working on integrating the same in next few days. . | 2.2.5 Document Embedding . For a longish article, sometimes you would like to split it in different files and combine them together. This workflow is usually better for writing as well; as each document can be focussed on a single aspect of entire topic you want to present in your article. . In org-mode it is trivial to do this using `#+INCLUDE` functionality. As an example above section on Fastpages functionality is actually part of a different blog published in here. I have just imported relevant portions for this post . #+INCLUDE: &quot;2020-04-29-Awesome-Org-Mode-Links.org::FastPages link&quot; :only-contents t . 2.2.6 Are you excited? . What I have done is just touch upon the surface of what is possible with org mode, and by extension blogging on fastpages with org mode. There are many more options and functionality available in org mode including beamer presentation, spreadsheets , agenda views etc&amp;#x2026; which are awesome but too broad to cover in this introductory blog post. However over time I will continue to post articles on some tidbits&#39; here and there which can greatly enhance your blogging workflow. Now I hope I have motivated you enough, so time to figure out to do it yourself. . 2.3 The How? . I have already shown earlier what org mode can do and how it can enhance your writing workflow. Now I will describe how you can do it yourself. Before I go into specifics let me share a bit on general design of fastpages and describe how it can be extended. . 2.3.1 Design of fastpages . So here is brief synopsis. Fastpages is based on Jekyll. It already provides you functionality to write a blog in markdown, notebook or word document. This is how it works . Markdown Blogging Markdown is the native format for Jekyll Blogging Engine. Jekyll uses an enhanced version of Markdown called Kramdown which comes with addtional functionality for source code coloring links etc&amp;#x2026; | Layout of Jekyll (Structure of html) is written in `Liquid` template engine. You have liquid templates in two places _layouts folder - used for defining page/post structure. | _includes folder - used to define general html blocks or additional functionality which may be included in an article | . | YAML Front Matter - Each article needs to have a yaml frontmatter which defines specifics like title, author, layout to choose, comments to include or exclude , categories , tags etc&amp;#x2026; which are either generic cross cutting functionality or indicator to select some specific configuration for blogging engine. It needs to come at very top of page | . | Notebook Blogging Notebook blogging is really what makes fastpages special for data scientist.I should rather specify and say python notebook blogging is what is possible natively in fastpages. Notebook blogging is enabled by a python package called &quot;nbdev&quot; another tool from FastAI. | The way it works is as follows You need to specify front matter in first cell of notebook | Import / Export/ Hide / Show/ Collapsible hide etc&amp;#x2026; are directive implemented as comments which need to appear on top of cell to indicate inclusion or exclution from html export | In reality notebooks from _notebook folder are converted to html[not markdown] and exported to _posts folder with a fake (.md) extension as an initial preprocessing step | From _post folder Jekyll machinery takes over to convert them into rendered site alongwith markkdown posts | Fastpages provides various shims(utlities/methods) to convert some notebook specific directives for links, youtube or boxes to liquid include templates. These are then converted by Jekyll to final version of site. | . | . | Word Blogging Word blogging structure is a similar It uses pandoc for &quot;docx&quot; to &quot;html&quot; conversion. Which is copied to _posts folder with (.md) extension | Some shim methods are provided by FastPages to handle jekyll _includes and _layout nicely | For Words there is only one place to specify &quot;Front Matter&quot;. It is _actionfiles/wordfrontmatter.txt file | . | . | Automation via Github Actions All processing automation are handled by Github Actions Checkout code to some machine | Cleaning up old _site/ html | Convert files in _notebooks and _word to _posts | Building the site using Jekyll into _site | Copying / Commiting the _site folder to ghpages etc.. | . | Everything in Github Actions are handled by services/ different docker containers running different scripts | For local viewing a parallel system is provided using docker-compose.yml and Makefile. | . | 2.3.2 General Idea for extension . So based on the intuition above we basically need to figure out 3 pieces . Way to convert custom format to html( with fake .md extension) or actual kramdown style markdown. It needs to have a way to insert/ send YAML FrontMatter to exported files | Some customization scripts to handled Jekyll _include template nicely to manage look and feel | Automation Code Github Action [ Include an addtional conversion step in ci.yml or integrate with existing action files possibly in _actionfiles/actionentrypoint.sh] | Update Docker Compose and Makefile | . | . 2.3.3 Org Mode Blogging . So with the ideas above , I managed to create some extensions and tricks to enable org mode blogging. It has following parts . Org File Customization A small customization is required to export frontmatter from org file. . #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+BEGIN_EXPORT html layout: post categories: [orgmode] title: Blogging with Org mode and FastPages description: Tutorial to setup Fastpages with org mode comments: true #+END_EXPORT # COMMENT OPTIONAL FROM HERE &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;https://gongzhitaao.org/orgcss/org.css&quot;/&gt; #+TOC: headline 3 . Here first line disabling is for disabling toc specfic to org mode | I use org mode specific publishing framework which comes alongwith Emacs. | Then comes section for YAML front matter. Wrapping it in html export block allows this to be the first section on the file. | In my export configuration, which I will talk about later, I have some settings which only export body of converted html document. | You can&#39;t include #+TITLE directive in org mode , as it is rendered before everything , and thus interfere&#39;s with Front Matter. | Things below OPTIONAL FROM HERE line need not be included. [ In fact I am still looking forward to customize css so that we can colorize source code similar to notebooks and markdown] | With these simple rules, you can easily write a blog post with all the functionality of org mode. | . | FastPages Customization I have done minimal non invasive customization to enable automation for org mode in fast pages. . . All the code described below is available in github repo: https://github.com/Rahuketu86/FastPagesDev . Folder Structure We need to create a _org folder . Inside _org folder , it should mirror structure of top level directories as follows . Structure of _org directory in fastpages . . Note: For local images always assume root to be _org [The structure of _org directory should be replica of blog folder structure]. Images will always start with `/images` or `/assets` . | Github Action Customization I have created some custom actions, which I save in _customactionsfiles directory at top level. It has got 3 files publish.el - Emacs script to control publishing from _org//posts to _posts folder and converting org to html. .

I add an addtional step to convert org files in my ci.yaml to enable this conversion automatically on git push.

Org mode on emacs is a really powerful tool for text processing, writing and literate programming. With all the development done on this repository now it is fairly easy to get started with org mode on fastpages. In future similar techniques can be adopted to create exporter for Rmarkdown or literate-julia or any other target. In view of author, it is important to use the language native to programming system to build these extensions. So for Rmarkdown , it would be useful to leverage existing infrastructure in &quot;knitr&quot; and &quot;bookdown/ blogdown&quot; packages rather than building things from scratch or extending nbdev. This is less burdensome to maintain and enables a writing flow where we don&#39;t have to go back and forth from existing system. . Now even though lot of functionality is enabled in orgmode bridge to fastpages, which mirrors or sometimes extend notebook version there are a few pending issues . 3.2 Outstanding Tasks . TODO Fix links inside boxes in org mode | TODO Define a specific layout for org files which can include some common header files. | TODO Define a mechanism for code highlighting . Tip: It can be done using custom css like org.css. But thing approach need some customization to match with default styles . Tip: Another approach is to use highlight.js and minor customization to read code blocks. This may be more reliable way to approach this . | TODO Handle internal links and html export more robustly | TODO Enable org-reveal functionality to directly generate and intergrate reveal-js presentation in blog post | TODO Create a demo for exporting to beamer and intergrating with blog post . Tip: Some custom function to streamline above might need to be included in fpemacs.el . I hope you find this blog post informative to get started with org mode.Please share your suggestions below which can help in improving or extending this setup. . |",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
